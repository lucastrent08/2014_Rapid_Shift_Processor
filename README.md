# 2014_Rapid_Shift_Processor
This was a CISC processor that was designed to use the Calculus of Finite Differences to optimize memory storage. It had some novel features that 
made it a good substitute for a conventional processor because it used far less memory. Particularly, the processor was ideal for the data compression 
relevant to control systems.
It has since been eclipsed, but I now am able to legally show it off.

This processor was built for a mere Spartan-3E so anybody can duplicate it now.
